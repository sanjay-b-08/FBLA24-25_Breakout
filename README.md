FBLA Game Title: Breakout

Description: "Breakout" is an immersive decision-based game where players take on the role of an inmate framed for a crime they didn’t commit. The goal is to escape from a high-security prison by navigating increasingly guarded areas, using stealth, problem-solving, and a range of skills to avoid detection.
However, "Breakout" introduces a unique twist: ethical dilemmas. Players are constantly faced with difficult choices that impact not only their path to freedom but also the the consequences that come with it. Do you take the riskier route that avoids harming anyone, or choose a faster, more dangerous path that could have collateral consequences? Every decision shapes the outcome of the escape, leading to multiple possible endings based on the player's morals.
In this game, escaping isn’t just about strategy and skill; it’s about balancing personal survival with ethical responsibility. How far will you go to secure your freedom?

How the Project implements Ethical Challenges: "Breakout" demonstrates ethical challenges by putting players in morally complex situations where their decisions have real consequences. As players attempt to escape the prison, they are frequently faced with choices that test their personal ethics. For example, they may need to decide whether to pickpocket innocent guards or leave them unaffected at the cost of risking capture. These decisions force players to weigh the urgency of their own survival against the potential harm they might cause to others. By presenting multiple outcomes based on these choices, the game encourages players to reflect on the consequences of their actions, making ethics a central theme of the gameplay. The dynamic between achieving freedom and maintaining moral integrity creates an experience where success is not just about escaping, but about how one chooses to escape.

Entertainment: "Breakout" combines high-stakes action with strategic decision-making, giving players a compelling reason to stay engaged. The thrill of outsmarting guards, solving puzzles, and navigating through an extreme security prison creates a sense of urgency and excitement. The ethical challenges add depth, making the game more than just a straightforward escape—players are intrigued by how their decisions shape the outcome. The multiple possible endings based on these choices give a strong incentive to replay the game, exploring different strategies and moral paths.

Overall, "Breakout" is a high-stakes, decision-driven escape game where your choices shape your destiny. Outsmart guards, navigate treacherous prison corridors, and face tough ethical dilemmas as you fight for your freedom. How far will you go to escape—and at what cost?
